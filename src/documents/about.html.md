# All About JT (Jeff Turner)

## As A Kid

I grew up in Colorado but also lived in Germany, southern California, and was born in Seattle, Washington. I have been programming since I was 10 years old, when my dad brought home a Commodore 64. As a kid I learned Basic, C, and lots of DOS batch scripts. I also ran a [Remote Access BBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemoteAccess) bulletin board system from my room starting out with 2400 baud modem, 8088 IBM computer, and DOS.

## During College Years

Once I graduated from [Centaurus High School](http://schools.bvsd.org/p12/centaurus) I went into the [United States Marine Corps](https://www.marines.com) where I was a part of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines. My job was an artillery radar operator (MOS 0842 - Field Artillery Radar Operator). While in the Marines I built a few simple websites, back in those days it was all simple HTML and blink tags.

## Professional Jobs

Once I got out of the Marines I got a real programming job at [Parsons Brinckerhoff](http://www.pbworld.com/) where I worked on a product called [Project Solve](https://www.projectsolvesp.com/) which allowed big construction companies to collaborate on their projects by reporting on progress and all aspects of the project. This was all ASP, VBScript, and SQL Server 7 at the time.

My next job was working at an internet data center company called Inflow. Here I did the same thing with ASP, VBScript, and SQL Server 7. I also integrated their data center monitoring into a product called Aperture to help with internet data center management. I got laid off from this job and the company was eventually sold.

My next job I moved to San Diego and started to work for [American Specialty Health](https://www.ashcompanies.com/). I worked here for almost 11 years. I started out on the [Healthroards](https://www.healthyroads.com/) which was an online store at the time written in ASP, VBScript, and using SQL Server 2000. We eventually moved to .Net, VB.net, and many years later to C#. I worked on almost all the teams over the years at this company, helping with their call center app and even building a code generator that I believe is still being used (I'm so sorry guys).

I now work at [Thomson Reuters Elite](http://www.elite.com/) on the [3E](http://www.elite.com/3e/) framework tools team where I have mostly worked on tools to make installing and managing 3E faster.

I have also built many custom themes in PHP for [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).

## Whats Next

For the last couple of years I have also been learning [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) which has been a big passion and I am hoping to move off the Microsoft stack to it in the next year.
