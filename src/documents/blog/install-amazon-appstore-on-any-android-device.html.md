I have made a few Android apps over the last 3 years. I have recently had issues with the Google Play store flagging my apps as not compliant but there is no one at Google that you can talk too, unlike Amazon and the iOS stores. So I have taken down all of my apps from Google Play. If you have installed my apps before and want the latest you will now have to go to the Amazon AppStore to get them. I find their store better in all regards besides not having as many devices. We need to change that! So here is how you install the Amazon AppStore on any Android device.

1. You need to go to the Setting and from the Application (older Android Versions) or Security (newer Android devices) turn on the setting Unknown sources, allow installation of non-market applications. ![Android Unknown Source Setting](/images/blog/amazon-appstore/unknown-sources.png)
1. Next goto this URL on the Android Device: http://www.amazon.com/getappstore
1. Once you have downloaded the APK file you can now install it via the notification or from the downloads app.

That is it and now you can buy and download the free apps from the Amazon AppStore which in my mind is a far better store. You will always be able to download all my apps from here and until Google figures out that the developers are what make the store I don't plan on posting my personal apps in that store again.
