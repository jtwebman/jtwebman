Lately I have been a very bad programmer. I have been doing it professionally now for over 15 years but for the last 5 or so I seem to go straight to the code editor once I have a great idea or once I say yes to a project. I did learn the correct way to design software but since going agile the teams I have worked on and even while working on my own stuff I just go straight to writing code. Well, sometimes we do a really small white board season on a complex part but no real design at all.

So first I wanted to figure out why. Did I think it was stopping me from being creative? Did I think it was more agile to build than refactor without design? Did I think I knew everything and could design it all in my head as I typed? I think it might have been a little of all three. Now I know I don't know everything (it took 35+ years to figure that out), but none of these are good reasons and are just false.

So once I figure that out my first instinct was to sit down and watch some videos on basic object oriented programming practices.

I found many gems from these videos but the big one was just him walking through the 5 steps to doing design.

1. Gather **Requirements**
1. **Describe** the application
1. **Identify** the main objects
1. Describe the **interactions**
1. Create a **class diagram**

Now don't get me wrong, I have been gathering requirements but most of the time they are in my head and never written down. This is bad, so to start over I decided to pick the project I have been working on for a couple months and write down the requirements for it. I have been working with a friend [Emily](https://twitter.com/EmilyKolberg) on it so I hope she is ok with making this public.

For the next step I needed to describe the application so I went ahead and wrote up some user stories and some use cases for the app. It has been 5 plus years since I have written a correct use case but I would love your feedback on how well or bad I did so far.

This didn't take more than an hour to write up and I ended up sticking with the CRC cards I made as the feature image on this post. It is a little different than what I have now for the site and it fixes some of the issues I have been having. So lesson learned, I am using paper and a little design for all the projects I work on going forward.
