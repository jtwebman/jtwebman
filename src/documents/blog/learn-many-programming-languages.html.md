I have learned many programming languages over the 28 years I have been programming here is a few in no particular order: Basic, C, C++, Java, C#, VB.Net, VBScript, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, Objective-C, Perl, Pascal, a few domain languages I wrote, and currently learning Erlang and Elixir. I couldn't write an application in most of them today but I have read at least one book and work through the examples in that book. I love learning and I love programming with a huge passion. I tell you this because I wanted to talk about why I have chosen to learn so many different programming languages and how it can help me. I hope in turn I can inspire you to learn a new one as well.

One of the biggest reasons I think to learn different languages is that different languages can be better at solving different problems. In our heads it is easier to take our primary language at the time and solve all your problems with it. A DBA tends to solve problems with SQL and a .Net programmer solvers them with C#. Doing it this way works but you might just be missing out on an easier way to solve the problem. Sometimes you will learn the new way to solve the problem and bring it back to one of your primary languages. Sometimes you get this calling and end up switching to that language. If you never learn it just a little then for sure you are never going to know.
