This week I wanted to talk about how I see enterprise software projects fail. I have work for a few big companies now and seen many software projects get to the point where every-time we fix one thing 10 other things break. I have even been a part of their design, so I am not saying I am not a part of it. I still feel bad if anyone has to maintain the code I wrote 10 years ago. I just wanted to talk about just a few of the reasons I see enterprises and their software projects fail. Don't get me wrong they all mostly do what they were built to do and if you put a good enough sales force behind them they all seem be able to sell. That is on the surface but if you take a look under the hood what you see might just scare you.

## Wasn't Design To Do What It Does

If these software where projects are in this broken state, they almost always do 90%+ more then what they were originally built to do. We as software programmers do set out to do the right thing. I don't think any of use think we are designing or building ourselves a nightmare to maintain. We draw on the white boards and design a system with the few requirements we have gotten from the project manager or sales team. Its perfect, well we think it is, so we set off and build it.

We come back a month later to show off what we have so far and they say. Well it is close but what if it could do this? Or can it do that? We say sure, and go off and put those features in. This happens for a few months and by this time the system is very different. Then you ask for one more thing but it is a big change so we say sure we can do it but we need to refactor (re-write) a bunch of the code to do it correctly as the system has changed from what we originally talked about.

This is where the problems starts. I have been in many of these meetings and the answer 90% of the time is we can't do that. What can you do if you don't refactor? I am not sure how you fix this. I personally really push to let us make the change correctly. Remember this isn't a startup where if we don't go live next week we are all on the street. This is a huge company that can afford a little extra time to get it correct, or at least to a point where it is maintainable. This doesn't happen and it is like a broken window in an abandon building. Once there is one it isn't long till they are all broken.

## Not Built To Change

- Big frameworks Bad
- Silo Sections Good
- Composition Over Inheritance

## Reinventing the Wheel

- We can't use Open Source

## Not Open to Change

- This is how we have always done it
- I have worked here 13 years why do I have to change
- Not willing to let bad apples go

## 10 Managers To Sign Off

- Why does every team at at 60,000 employee company have to do it the same way?
- Does the little you save on doing everything the same hurt you?

## In Closing

This was a little bit of a rant, and for legal reasons I need to say this is my view and not my current, past, or future companies view or issues. I just feel big enterprise companies could learn from these mistakes. There is no reason why you can changed now. Just giving unlimited vacation, free soda, and free breakfast isn't going to work. Cutting back on coffee and tea and holiday parties is even worse though. So at least try to care about your employees. If you don't none of the good ones will stay long.

The real goal though is to make awesome software and to stay at the top. Not to let a small startup with 5 people kick your 100+ person team. To do that you need to have a mission everyone get get behind and to make it a team effort. We are all in this together! If you can find a way to create that it will not be hard to keep great people around and to ship awesome, ever changing, software.
