A few months back I watch a video that Gary Vaynerchuk (Gary Vee) posted that really got me thinking and wanting to share it. At the time he wanted more then anything for people to be self-aware. Not just aware of their strengths but their weakness as well. At the time I was like that really isn't me. I know what I am good at and what I am bad at, right? Well until this post and some of the things I have been working through the last few weeks I don't think I did.

For those that don't know who Gary Vaynerchuk is, here are the two videos I am talking about.

## Who is the Real JT?

I'm a **creator**. I love to build things using code that make peoples' lives easier. I love to learn new things and share and teach others. These are my strengths.

## Who Am I Not?

I have said multiple times that I want to own my own software company to build some great application but I am not sure that is the case. Yes I have lots of great ideas but so do you. It is all about execution and that isn't my strength. I think I got hung up on the social media entrepreneur mentality. I have also always wanted to work for myself but I don't need to be an entrepreneur with some big software company to create.

## Doubling Down on My Strengths

I am going to double down on my strengths and start accepting my shortcomings. I plan on writing on this blog far more now. I am going to market it, gather a community of people that also enjoy creating, and showing them how to make a living doing it. Do I know how at this point? Nope, but finding out how is one of my strengths and as I learn I hope to share it with others.

I understand I have been lucky that one of my creative outlets has been computer programming. It has helped me make a bunch on money but it isn't just about the money. I want the freedom to create without the pressure of going into work and working on someone else's dream. I want to be able to travel and not worry about the office or only do it for the 2 to 3 weeks a year I get vacation. If someone in my family is sick I want to be able to stay home and make sure they are better.

## Thank You, Gary

So I want to first thank Gary Vaynerchuk for everything he creates as well as calling me out on my baggage. I am sure he will be the subject of some of the posts on here.

Self-awareness is one of the most powerful tools we have as humans. It allows us to play to our strengths while acknowledging and working around our weaknesses. Gary's message really resonated with me and helped me understand that I don't need to be everything to everyone - I just need to be the best version of myself.

## Discussion

What has helped you become more self-aware? Have you had any "aha" moments about your true strengths and weaknesses?
