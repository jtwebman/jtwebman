                        My programming story started in 1986 with an IBM 8088 and a curiosity that
                        wouldn't quit. What began as a teenager tinkering with code has evolved into
                        a 25+ year career where I've had the privilege of building systems that
                        scale, leading teams that deliver, and mentoring engineers who've gone on to
                        do incredible things.

                        Since turning professional in 1999, I've learned that software engineering
                        isn't just about writing code—it's about solving real problems for real
                        people. Whether it was developing custom WordPress themes for The Geekie
                        Awards, creating open-source plugins like Bookshelf-scopes to make database
                        querying easier, or architecting scalable solutions at HARMAN International,
                        each project taught me something new about both technology and leadership.

                        As an Engineering Manager and now Principal Software Engineer at HARMAN
                        International, I've discovered that the best technical solutions come from
                        understanding both the code and the people writing it. I'm known for
                        breaking down complex projects into impactful, customer-value goals and
                        providing realistic timelines that actually work— something my teams
                        appreciate when deadlines are tight and stakeholders are watching.

                        can't lead what you don't understand. Whether we're building with Node.js
                        and PostgreSQL, React and React Native, or exploring new technologies, I'm
                        right there with my team, sleeves rolled up, working through the problems

                        Over the years, I've worked with 15+ programming languages—not because I
                        collect them like trophies, but because each one taught me a different way
                        to think about problems. These days, I'm particularly drawn to functional
                        programming patterns in TypeScript, finding they lead to more maintainable
                        code and fewer bugs in production.

                        education comes from building systems that need to work under pressure,
                        scale with growth, and be maintained by teams that change over time.

                        These days, you'll find me working on two very different but equally
                        exciting projects. First, I'm building Roblox games with my daughter—there's
                        something magical about sharing the joy of creating with the next
                        generation. Our latest game, Fire Storm, has been a fantastic
                        father-daughter coding adventure.

                        I'm also deep into building AI-powered starter repositories, exploring how
                        we can use intelligent tools to help developers bootstrap projects faster
                        and better. It's the kind of work that gets me excited about the future of
                        software development—not replacing developers, but making us all more
                        effective.

                        human problems with technology. They mentor junior developers, communicate
                        clearly with stakeholders, and build systems that their future selves (and
                        teammates) will thank them for.
